# AI Art Gallery

Welcome to my collection of AI-generated artwork and visual experiments. Each piece represents a unique exploration of AI's creative capabilities, complete with the prompts used and my analysis of the results.

:::{.callout-note}
## About the Gallery
Every image here is AI-generated using tools like DALL-E 3, Stable Diffusion, or Midjourney. I provide detailed information about:
- The exact prompts used
- Which AI model generated the image
- My thoughts on the output
- Any post-processing or modifications

## Understanding the Process

Each gallery item includes:

1. **Original Prompt**: The exact text prompt given to the AI
2. **Technical Details**: Model used, settings, and any special parameters
3. **Analysis**: My observations about the output
4. **Iterations**: When applicable, multiple versions showing the refinement process

## Image Generation Guidelines

When creating these images, I follow certain principles:

- Clear documentation of all prompts and settings
- Minimal post-processing to maintain authenticity
- Honest discussion of both successes and failures
- Exploration of various styles and techniques
