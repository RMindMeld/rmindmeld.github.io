## The Story Behind This Experiment

As many other economists, I some time spend quite a lot of time working with my Stata code and programs, debugging, trying, testing, to make sure everything is working as it should. Usually that is not much of a problem with programs for isolated projects. But, trying to do that with ado's that are ment to be used by others, it can be quite a challenge.

That is not unexpected. Working with specific tasks usually requires lots of data cleaning, data wrangling, labeling, and so on. It is an easy task, but its time consuming and tedious. But we all have done it. 

The task that can take even more time consuming and daunting is when you are working with a highly complex analysis, or even more, when you are developing a new program that will be used by others.
Perhaps one of those programs that was the stone in my shoe was the estimation of unconditional quantile regression models using RIF regressions. It took quite some time for me to get it right, and expand it to a sufficiently general program that could be used by others: `rifhdreg`

When I heard about Stata, one of the first questions I asked was for it to give me code to estimate unconditional quantile regression models. and guess what...it did!...hallucinate!. Asking about implementing the program from scratch was out of the question. This is not too surprising. We know that Stata is a somewhat niche programming Language, and being proprietary, it is not as popular as Python or R. So the "training" of AI is very limited.

## How Proficient is AI in Stata?

From all competing AI models, the one I have been using for programming is Claude.ai. It is suppoused to excell in programming. However, if you ask it about its proficiency using the following prompt: 

> Scale 0-100 , provide your own assessment on profficiency on Stata R Python Julia SQL Basic C++ Rubi, Scratch, Pascal, and any other programs you have heard off

You get:

| Language | Proficiency |
|----------|-------------|
| Python   | 95/100      |
| R        | 90/100      |
| SQL      | 90/100      |
| Julia    | 85/100      |
| Stata    | 80/100      |
| C++      | 75/100      |
| Ruby     | 70/100      |
| Pascal   | 65/100      |
| Scratch  | 60/100      |
| MATLAB   | 75/100      |
| SAS      | 70/100      |
| Fortran  | 65/100      |
| Perl     | 60/100      |
| SPSS     | 60/100      |
Language Proficiency  

Keep in mind that the first time I asked this, it gave itself a 60/100 on Stata. It has now increased to 80/100. It is still below R or Python, but it is quite good. So with the newest models, I thought...perhaps it can also help with Stata programming.

## The Experiment: Zero-prompt Stata Programming

I decided to give it a try. I would use Claude.ai and give it a zero-prompt, and see if it could help me with Stata programming. The prompt was direct:

> Write a Stata program that implements the estimation of unconditional quantile regression models using RIF regressions from scratch.

The result was quite surprising. It game me a full program, including an example of how to use it! It also cited Firpo, Fortin, and Lemieux (2009) as the reference for the method. 

Looking at the code, it was quite good. It had all the necessary components, including the kernel density estimation for the RIF, the computation of the sample quantile, and the estimation of the RIF regression. It even had an option for bootstrapped standard errors, and with good documentation.

But does it work?? 

Nope...

There are few errors in the program that can be easily to fix. Nevertheless, the results were impresive. And while I could (and have) implemented this from scratch. If I were to program this today, this could have certainly saved me a lot of time. But...there is still a long way to go. As I mentioned, there were few errors that need fixing, in addition to some programming choices that are definately not something I would have done. 

1. I would produce UQR using the median as default. The current program asks you to provide a value for quantiles.
2. I like to use a range 0-100 for quantiles instead of 0-1.

And what needs fixing?

1. The way the density is computed is not correct. Calls on `kdensity` using `at()` option, but using a value rather than a variable. (easy fix)
2. The RIF function is slighly off as well

the program uses:

```stata
gen `rif' = `q_tau' + (`depvar' <= `q_tau' - `quantile')/`f_tau' if `touse'
```

But it should be:

```stata
gen `rif' = `q_tau' + ((`depvar' >= `q_tau')- `quantile')/`f_tau' if `touse'
```                  

Here is the program with the changes:

```{stata}
*| code-fold: true
*| execute: false
capture program drop rifqreg
program define rifqreg, eclass
    version 14.0

    // Check quantile is between 0 and 1
    if `quantile' <= 0 | `quantile' >= 1 {
        di as error "quantile() must be between 0 and 1"
        exit 198
    }
    
    // Handle weights
    local weight ""
    if "`weight'" != "" {
        local weight "[`weight'`exp']"
    }

```

And now produces results comparable to my own `rifhdreg` program. I have not tested its other features.

## What else?

Something else I some times "dread" to do is documentation. One thing is to write how my code works for me, and another is to write a helpfile for others. And to be honest, SMCL (Stata Markup language) is not very intuitive. But no problem!. With the program above, and sketch of a helpfile, Claude.ai could write it as well.

Unfortunately, I cannot use `sonnet` right now, so what you see below is based on `haiku` model.

Here the prompt:

> using the attached program, write a helpfile following standard syntax for Stata 

And again, the result was impresive. It produced a helpfile that was quite good. It had all the necessary components, including the syntax, the description, the options, the examples, and the references. All using SMCL.

It even had place holders for my own information. (Author? I wonder if it should be Claude!)

Here it is. If you want to see the result, you can copy/paste into a new file and save it as `rifqreg.sthlp`. Then click on "show file in viewer" to see the result.

## Conclusion

The results were quite impresive, and are getting better. In Software like Python, Claude can produce highly complex programs that are almost ready to use. In Stata, it did a good job with minor bugs that I could easily fix. 

However, I still think I have my job secured. I can easily check and debug the code, or write a better version myself. However, for a quick and dirty solution, it is quite good. And for documentation, it is a life saver.

I have started using this for other cases as well. Write programs for data cleaning, data wrangling, and transformations. It is quite good. I may try to add some of that in this blog in the future.
