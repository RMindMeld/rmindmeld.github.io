## Who's Behind MindMeld?

Hi! I'm FRA, and MindMeld is my personal exploration into the fascinating world of AI-generated content. As someone interested in the potential of artificial intelligence, I created this space to document my experiments, discoveries, and insights in AI content creation.

I'm relatively new to AI. I'm not a developer, but I do have a background on Econometrics and Data Analysis. When ChatGPT was popularized, I started to experiment with it, at least as a hobby, to understand the novelty of AI. As an Instructor, I have seen AI being recived with skepticism, and I wanted to understand it better. 

I don't claim to be an expert, but I like to believe I'm sufficiently experienced in other areas of research and learning, that I can bring some perspective to using AI. Besides, this is just a journey of discovery, my more serious work is done on other projects.

So, I decided to document what I discover along the way. Hopefully, this will be useful to others who are curious about AI, content creation, or the future of digital creativity.

Interesting enough. This site was generated using Quarto, but generated using AI, Specifically using Coder by <Kodu.ai>, which is a programming agent that works with Claude by Anthropic. Highly recommend it!

## What Makes MindMeld Different?

Unlike many AI content platforms (frankly do not know any), MindMeld is deliberately personal and experimental, but open for suggestions. Here, you'll find:

- Raw AI outputs alongside my human perspective
- Honest discussions about both successes and failures
- A transparent look at how AI content is generated and curated
- Personal insights into what works and what doesn't

## My Approach

I believe in a straightforward approach to AI content:

1. **Generation**: I use various AI tools to create different types of content
2. **Curation**: I personally review and select interesting outputs
3. **Context**: I add my thoughts and observations
4. **Sharing**: I publish everything here, including the occasional mishaps

## Tools I Use

Some of the AI tools I frequently experiment with:

- GPT models for text generation. ChatGPT, Claude, etc.
- Stable Diffusion for image creation. DALL-E, thanks to OpenAI, and Meta and Copilot by Microsoft.
- Various specialized AI tools for specific content types, Like Suno for music, or NotebookLM for Podcasts.

I try to clearly indicate which tools were used for each piece of content. Occasionally, I will provide my own work, with help of AI.

## The Philosophy

MindMeld isn't about presenting AI as perfect or infallible. Instead, it's about:

- Exploring AI's creative capabilities honestly
- Understanding the intersection of human and machine creativity
- Documenting the learning process
- Sharing insights with others interested in AI content creation

## Interested in Collaboration?
Whether you're an AI enthusiast, creator, or just curious about the technology, I'm always open to interesting conversations and collaborations.

## Site Updates

I will try to update MindMeld regularly with new experiments, insights, and discoveries. It will most likely happen in clusters. Periods with lots of contents, and periods of hiatus. Its hard to keep up with real work, family and hobbies. The best way to keep up with new content is to:

- Follow me on social media (perhaps)
- Check the [blog](blog/index.qmd) regularly
- Check the [podcasts](podcasts/index.qmd) regularly
