## Site-Wide Assets

### Favicon

```
Create a minimalist icon showing a stylized brain merged with a circuit board, using only two colors: deep blue (#2D46B9) and white. The design should be simple enough to work as a favicon.
```

### Hero Image

```
Create a wide banner image showing a seamless blend of human creativity and AI, with flowing abstract patterns transitioning between organic brushstrokes and digital pixels. Use a color palette of deep blues, purples, and white. The style should be modern and sophisticated, suitable for a website header.
```

## Blog Posts

### AI Content Exploration Post

```
Create a split-screen image showing a robot artist and its canvas. On the left, a sleek, modern robot with delicate appendages holding a paintbrush. On the right, an abstract painting in progress with vibrant colors. The lighting should be warm and studio-like, with subtle highlights on the robot's metallic surface.
```

### Robot Artist Image
**File**: assets/blog/robot-artist.jpg
```
Create an image of a sophisticated robot sitting at an easel, painting a sunset. The robot should have precise, delicate hands and be designed for artistic work. The scene should be set in a modern art studio with natural light streaming in. Include scattered art supplies and tools around the workspace.
```

## Gallery

### Abstract Emotion Series
**File**: assets/gallery/abstract-emotion-1.jpg
```
Create an abstract art piece representing joy and wonder. Use flowing, organic shapes and vibrant colors (yellows, bright blues, and warm pinks). The composition should show movement and energy through sweeping curves and dynamic forms. Avoid any recognizable objects or figures, focusing purely on emotional expression through color and form.
```

### Landscape Series
**File**: assets/gallery/landscape-1.jpg
```
Generate a surreal landscape where natural and artificial elements merge seamlessly. Show floating islands with both lush vegetation and geometric structures, connected by streams of light or data. Use a color palette of deep greens, blues, and purple, with highlights of golden light. The style should be both photorealistic and fantastical.
```

## Podcast

### Episode 1 Cover
**File**: assets/podcasts/ep001-cover.jpg
```
Create a podcast cover image showing a modern microphone transforming into streams of digital data. The design should be clean and professional, with a dark background and glowing blue accents. Include subtle circuit board patterns in the background. The composition should work well as a square thumbnail.
```

### Series Cover
**File**: assets/podcasts/series-cover.jpg
```
Design a main podcast cover image featuring a human profile silhouette merged with AI patterns. Use a deep blue to purple gradient background with flowing, technological patterns. Include subtle audio waveforms that transform into neural network connections. The design should be sophisticated and minimal.
```

## Experiments

### Prompt Engineering Study
**File**: assets/experiments/prompt-comparison-chart.png
```
Create a clean, modern infographic showing three different approaches to AI prompting. Use a minimalist design with icons and flow charts. The color scheme should use blue (#2D46B9) as the primary color with gray accents. Include simple visualizations of input/output relationships.
```

## Profile Images

### About Page Profile
**File**: assets/profile.jpg
