# Visualization Projects for HWFWM Dataset

## Basic Analysis

1. Create a histogram of Power distribution across all characters
2. Generate box plots for all core statistics (Power, Vitality, Speed, Recovery, Control)
3. Create a pie chart showing the distribution of character Classes
4. Plot the distribution of Essence ratings using a density plot
5. Create a bar chart showing the count of characters in each Achievement Rank

## Relationships and Correlations

6. Create a correlation heatmap for all core statistics
7. Generate scatter plots between Power and Health, including a trend line
8. Plot the relationship between Control and Mana using a scatter plot with class-based coloring
9. Create a bubble plot showing the relationship between Power, Vitality, and Health (size of bubbles)
10. Generate a pair plot for all core statistics, colored by Class

## Level and Experience Analysis

11. Create a histogram of character levels with Achievement Rank coloring
12. Plot the relationship between Level and Experience using a scatter plot
13. Generate box plots of core statistics grouped by Achievement Rank
14. Create a violin plot showing the distribution of Levels across different Classes
15. Plot average core statistics by Level groups (1-20, 21-40, etc.)

## Class-Based Analysis

16. Create radar charts comparing average core statistics for each Class
17. Generate stacked bar charts showing the distribution of Achievement Ranks within each Class
18. Plot the distribution of Essence ratings across different Classes using violin plots
19. Create box plots of derived statistics (Health, Mana, Attack, Defense) grouped by Class
20. Generate a heatmap showing the average core statistics for each Class

## Skills Analysis

21. Create a bar chart showing the most common skills across all characters
22. Generate a network graph showing skill co-occurrence patterns
23. Plot the distribution of skill counts across different Classes
24. Create a heatmap showing skill frequency by Achievement Rank
25. Generate a sunburst chart showing the hierarchy of Class → Skills → Achievement Rank

## Advanced Visualizations

26. Create a parallel coordinates plot for all core statistics, colored by Class
27. Generate a t-SNE plot of characters based on their core statistics, colored by Achievement Rank
28. Plot a Sankey diagram showing the flow from Class → Achievement Rank → Most Used Skill
29. Create a 3D scatter plot showing Power, Vitality, and Speed, colored by Class
30. Generate a chord diagram showing the relationships between Classes and most common Skills

## Notes for Visualization

- Consider using appropriate color schemes for different types of data
- Include proper titles, labels, and legends for all visualizations
- Add trend lines or smoothing where appropriate
- Consider using interactive visualizations for complex relationships
- Include error bars or confidence intervals where applicable
- Use appropriate scales (log scale vs linear scale) based on data distribution
- Consider adding annotations to highlight interesting patterns
- Ensure visualizations are accessible (colorblind-friendly palettes)
- Include proper data transformations where necessary
- Consider adding interactive tooltips for detailed information

## Recommended Tools

- Python: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, bokeh
- R: ggplot2, plotly, highcharter
- Both: D3.js for web-based interactive visualizations
