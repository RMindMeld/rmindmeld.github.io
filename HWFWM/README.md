# He Who Fights With Monsters Dataset Project

## Original Prompt
Create a program that simulates a dataset based on LitRPG characters from the series "He who fights with monsters". 
Aim for variables that are correlated across themselves and show appropriate "real" distributions.
The goal of the data will be to use it for various data visualization projects. So aim to provide diversity. 
Include with the dataset a full data dictionary. And a set of 30 questions of different visualization projects. 
Provide another page with potential solutions using R and Python.
