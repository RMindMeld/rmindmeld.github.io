    "text": "Who’s Behind MindMeld?\nHi! I’m FRA, and MindMeld is my personal exploration into the fascinating world of AI-generated content. As someone interested in the potential of artificial intelligence, I created this space to document my experiments, discoveries, and insights in AI content creation.\nI’m relatively new to AI. I’m not a developer, but I do have a background on Econometrics and Data Analysis. When ChatGPT was popularized, I started to experiment with it, at least as a hobby, to understand the novelty of AI. As an Instructor, I have seen AI being recived with skepticism, and I wanted to understand it better.\nI don’t claim to be an expert, but I like to believe I’m sufficiently experienced in other areas of research and learning, that I can bring some perspective to using AI. Besides, this is just a journey of discovery, my more serious work is done on other projects.\nSo, I decided to document what I discover along the way. Hopefully, this will be useful to others who are curious about AI, content creation, or the future of digital creativity.\nInteresting enough. This site was generated using Quarto, but generated using AI, Specifically using Coder by &lt;Kodu.ai&gt;, which is a programming agent that works with Claude by Anthropic. Highly recommend it!\n\n\n That’s me, probably generated by AI too!"
