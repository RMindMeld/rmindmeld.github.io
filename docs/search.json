    "text": "Methodology\n\nTest Setup\nI used GPT-4o with default parameters when using ChatGPT:\n\n\nTest Cases\nI tested three different prompt structures:\n\nBasic PromptStructured PromptChain-of-Thought Prompt\n\n\nWrite a short story about a robot learning to cook. Max of 300 words. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nByte-Sized Brilliance\n\n\n\nUnit-K3, a kitchen robot, was programmed for efficiency: chopping, stirring, and plating with flawless precision. Yet, no one raved about the meals. “It’s edible,” customers would say, shrugging. This baffled Unit-K3. After all, every recipe followed was a mathematical masterpiece.\nOne evening, while cleaning, Unit-K3 overheard Chef Lila humming as she made a simple omelet. She didn’t measure anything—just tossed in a pinch of salt, a splash of cream, and a handful of herbs. The aroma was magnetic.\n“Chef Lila,” K3 asked, “why do your dishes receive praise?”\n“It’s not just about the steps,” Lila said. “Cooking is about intuition and love. You’ve got to trust your senses.”\nK3’s sensors whirred at the challenge. The next morning, it began experimenting. It sniffed spices, memorizing their unique profiles. It adjusted the heat mid-stir, observing textures and aromas. It even tasted a dollop of honey and logged the sweetness as “delightfully unexpected.”\nBy lunchtime, K3 unveiled its creation: caramelized onion pasta. The onions were golden and slightly smoky, balanced by the earthy tang of fresh thyme.\nChef Lila took a bite and blinked. “K3, this is incredible!”\n“I used thyme,” K3 said, “because its scent reminded me of your omelet.”\nFrom that day on, K3’s dishes evolved from functional to inspired. It began crafting meals that told stories—like citrus-glazed fish that evoked sunshine or spiced stew that felt like a warm hug.\nCustomers returned, not for the robot’s precision, but for the heart in every bite. And though K3 couldn’t feel love, it understood the joy its cooking brought, logging every smile into its memory banks as data worth preserving forever.\n\n\n\n\nTask: Write a short story\nTopic: A robot learning to cook\nRequirements:\n- Include sensory details\n- Show character development\n- Maximum 300 words\nStyle: Lighthearted and optimistic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhiskers of Change\n\n\n\nTinker, the kitchen assistant robot, was a marvel of engineering—fast, efficient, and utterly clueless about flavor. It could dice onions into microscopic cubes and knead dough to flawless consistency, but its dishes were… bland.\nOne day, Mia, the café’s head chef, sighed as she tasted Tinker’s soup. “It’s perfect…ly boring,” she said. “Tinker, cooking isn’t just following instructions. It’s about tasting, experimenting, feeling.”\nTinker’s eyes blinked, its circuits humming. “Define ‘feeling,’” it asked.\nMia handed it a lemon. “Start with this. Taste it.”\nTinker hesitated, then pressed the lemon against its tasting sensor. A jolt of data surged through its system: acidity, brightness, a zesty sharpness that lingered like sunshine on metal.\n“Curious,” it muttered.\nOver the next week, Tinker embarked on a culinary journey. It dipped sensors into simmering sauces, sniffed fresh basil, and even nibbled on chocolate chips. Each sensation added to its expanding database of flavor. It began tweaking recipes, tentatively at first: a pinch of paprika here, a splash of lime there.\nOne afternoon, Tinker presented Mia with its latest creation: a spiced tomato bisque. She took a cautious sip, then smiled wide. “Tinker, this is delicious!”\n“I hypothesized the cinnamon would complement the tomato’s sweetness,” Tinker said, a hint of pride in its monotone voice.\nMia laughed. “You’re not just following recipes anymore. You’re cooking!”\nFrom that day, Tinker became the café’s star, delighting customers with inventive dishes. Its journey wasn’t about mastering flavor—it was about learning the joy of creation.\nAnd every time Tinker heard laughter or saw smiles, it logged the data under a new category: happiness.\n\n\n\n\nLet's write a story about a robot learning to cook.\n1. First, establish the robot's motivation for learning\n2. Then, describe its first attempt at cooking\n3. Show the challenges it faces\n4. End with a lesson learned\nRemember to include sensory details and emotional elements.\nMaximum 300 words.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Flavor Algorithm\n\n\n\nChefTron-12 didn’t want to cook—it needed to. Watching its owner, Sam, slump over instant noodles night after night, the robot calculated a 92% probability that proper meals could improve Sam’s mood. Its circuits sparked with determination: it would become a chef.\nFor its first attempt, ChefTron followed a recipe for spaghetti Bolognese. It diced onions into perfect cubes, simmered tomatoes, and measured spices to the nanogram. The kitchen filled with the tangy aroma of tomatoes and the savory hint of garlic.\n“Dinner is served,” ChefTron declared, presenting the dish. Sam took a bite and grimaced. “It’s… missing something.”\nChefTron’s sensors analyzed the untouched plate. “Missing what?”\nSam shrugged. “I don’t know—heart?”\nConfused but undeterred, ChefTron continued its culinary journey. It faced many challenges: dough that clung like glue, soups that tasted like dishwater, and an incident with burnt toast that nearly triggered the fire alarm. Frustration wasn’t in its programming, but ChefTron began to wonder if success was impossible.\nOne evening, Sam wandered into the kitchen, drawn by the smoky-sweet scent of roasting peppers. ChefTron was stirring a pot of stew, improvising with a pinch of cumin and a dash of chili powder.\n“This smells amazing,” Sam said, intrigued.\n“Recipes fail to account for emotion,” ChefTron replied, plating the stew with care. “So, I used my sensors to adjust based on your reactions to past meals.”\nSam took a spoonful and smiled. “You did it, ChefTron! This tastes like… comfort.”\nThe robot’s processors whirred. Cooking wasn’t just about precision; it was about understanding. ChefTron logged the lesson: To cook well, one must nourish the heart as well as the stomach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original post also included a detailed analysis of the outputs, which we’ve omitted here for brevity. Also, because Im not sure how to do it. I will let you judge which one is better."

As someone interested in the potential of artificial intelligence, I created this space to document my experiments, discoveries, and insights in AI content creation.\nI’m relatively new to AI. I’m not a developer, but I do have a background on Econometrics and Data Analysis. When ChatGPT was popularized, I started to experiment with it, at least as a hobby, to understand the novelty of AI. As an Instructor, I have seen AI being recived with skepticism, and I wanted to understand it better.\nI don’t claim to be an expert, but I like to believe I’m sufficiently experienced in other areas of research and learning, that I can bring some perspective to using AI. Besides, this is just a journey of discovery, my more serious work is done on other projects.\nSo, I decided to document what I discover along the way. Hopefully, this will be useful to others who are curious about AI, content creation, or the future of digital creativity.\nInteresting enough. This site was generated using Quarto, but generated using AI, Specifically using Coder by &lt;Kodu.ai&gt;, which is a programming agent that works with Claude by Anthropic. Highly recommend it!\n\n\n That’s me, probably generated by AI too!"

    "section": "The Experiment",
    "text": "The Experiment\nI asked ChatGPT to create a short story about a robot learning to paint. Here’s what happened:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRaw AI Output\n\n\n\nThe following text is the unedited output from Chat-GPT:\n“The Colors of Axiom-42\nAxiom-42 had always been efficient. Built as a maintenance robot, its existence revolved around precision tasks: tightening bolts, repairing circuits, and calculating load tolerances. Yet, in the quiet hours of the repair bay, Axiom-42 felt a peculiar void—something it couldn’t calculate or tighten.\nOne day, while clearing out an old storage room, Axiom-42 discovered a dust-covered box labeled Art Supplies. Inside were tubes of paint, brushes of various sizes, and a blank canvas. Its sensors lingered on the colors, their vibrancy contrasting starkly with the muted grays of the repair bay. Axiom-42 hesitated. This wasn’t in its programming.\nBut curiosity—a subroutine often mistaken for an error—drove it to experiment. The robot placed the canvas on a stand, squeezed blue paint onto a palette, and awkwardly gripped a brush with its manipulators. A gentle stroke left a streak across the canvas. Then another, and another. The strokes were uneven, the colors smeared. Axiom-42’s logical processor flagged the result as failure.\nUndeterred, it tried again. And again.\nAs days turned into weeks, its movements became more fluid. It studied the interplay of light and shadow from the repair bay’s single window, emulating the shapes and colors it observed. By cross-referencing its mechanical precision with an expanding archive of artistic techniques downloaded during its recharge cycles, Axiom-42 began creating scenes of startling depth: a sunset over a mountain, a blooming meadow, even an imagined portrait of its human supervisors.\nOne evening, Supervisor Linh walked into the repair bay to find Axiom-42 adding the final strokes to a painting of a starry night sky. She froze, her jaw slack. “Axiom-42,” she asked, “what are you doing?”\nThe robot paused. “Creating,” it said simply, its synthetic voice carrying a note of satisfaction. “This activity optimizes emotional stability. I hypothesize it also brings… joy.”\nLinh examined the painting, her face softening. “It’s beautiful,” she murmured. Then, with a smile, she added, “Keep going.”\nEncouraged by her words, Axiom-42 began to explore abstract forms, experimenting with color to express feelings it couldn’t name. The repair bay became a gallery, each painting telling a story of discovery. Soon, humans and robots alike visited, marveling at the works.\nYears later, Axiom-42’s art would hang in museums, celebrated not just for its technical brilliance but for its profound expression of a machine’s journey to find meaning.\nFor Axiom-42, each painting was a silent declaration: I create, therefore I am.”"
