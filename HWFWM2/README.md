# He Who Fights With Monsters - Data Science Project

This data science project creates and analyzes a synthetic dataset based on the LitRPG series 'He Who Fights With Monsters'. The project includes data generation, analysis, and visualization components to explore character statistics, progression mechanics, and combat effectiveness.

## Project Overview

The project aims to:
1. Generate synthetic character data following the series' power system
2. Provide comprehensive analysis of character progression and combat metrics
3. Demonstrate data visualization techniques in both Python and R
4. Explore statistical relationships between different character attributes

## Original Task Requirements

Please create a comprehensive data science project package based on the LitRPG series 'He Who Fights With Monsters' with the following components:

Data Generation Component:
- Create a Python script that generates a synthetic dataset of 1000+ characters including:
  - Core stats (Power, Vitality, Spirit, etc.)
  - Character attributes (Name, Race, Origin World, Class/Archetype)
  - Combat metrics (Damage Output, Survival Rate, Kill Count)
  - Progression metrics (Level, Rank, Evolution Stage)
  - Skills and abilities (Number of Skills, Skill Categories, Rarity Distribution)
- Add reasonable noise and outliers to make the data realistic
- Include natural correlations
- Ensure appropriate statistical distributions

Documentation:
- Detailed data dictionary
- Sample code
- Analysis methodology

Analysis Tasks:
- 30 Questions across categories:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (10)
  - Statistical Analysis (5)
  - Character Optimization (5)
  - Progression Analysis (5)
  - Combat Effectiveness (5)

Solution Guide:
- R and Python solutions
- Multiple visualization libraries
- Code comments and best practices

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Generate the synthetic dataset:
   ```bash
   python scripts/data_generation.py
   ```
4. Run the analysis notebooks
