## Overview

This collection contains three simulated datasets with realistic correlations and distributions, each based on a different theme. The datasets are designed for practicing SQL queries, data analysis, and exploring relationships between different entities within each theme.

## Available Datasets

### 1. [Lit-RPG: Sword and Magic](lit_rpg/docs/lit_rpg_dataset.qmd)

A fantasy RPG dataset featuring:
- Character statistics and progression
- Items with various properties and rarities
- Skills and abilities
- Character-item relationships
- Character-skill relationships

Perfect for analyzing:
- Character progression and balance
- Item distribution patterns
- Skill acquisition patterns
- Equipment strategies
- Character build optimization

### 2. [Pokemon: First Generation](pokemon/docs/pokemon_dataset.qmd)

A dataset based on the first generation of Pokemon games, including:
- Pokemon statistics and types
- Move properties and effects
- Type effectiveness relationships
- Pokemon-move relationships
- Battle mechanics data

Ideal for studying:
- Type advantage patterns
- Move effectiveness analysis
- Pokemon stat distributions
- Team composition strategies
- Battle outcome predictions

### 3. [Star Trek: Starships and Missions](star_trek/docs/star_trek_dataset.qmd)

A Star Trek universe dataset containing:
- Starship specifications
- Crew member details
- Mission records
- Ship systems status
- Mission logs

Great for analyzing:
- Fleet operations
- Mission success patterns
- Crew assignment optimization
- System maintenance impacts
- Resource allocation

## Dataset Generation

Each dataset is generated using Python scripts that ensure:
- Realistic correlations between attributes
- Appropriate distributions for different properties
- Logical relationships between entities
- Theme-appropriate constraints and rules
- Consistent internal logic

The generation code is available in each dataset's directory:
- `lit_rpg/generate_lit_rpg_data.py`
- `pokemon/generate_pokemon_data.py`
- `star_trek/generate_trek_data.py`

## Using the Datasets

Each dataset comes with:
1. Detailed documentation of the data structure
2. Comprehensive data dictionaries
3. Example SQL queries
4. Project ideas and suggestions
5. Analysis of relationships and correlations

### Prerequisites

To use these datasets, you'll need:
- A SQL database system (PostgreSQL recommended)
- Basic SQL knowledge
- Understanding of the respective theme (helpful but not required)

### Getting Started

1. Choose a dataset based on your interests or learning goals
2. Review the documentation to understand the data structure
3. Generate the data using the provided Python scripts
4. Load the data into your preferred database system
5. Start exploring with the example queries
6. Develop your own queries and analyses
