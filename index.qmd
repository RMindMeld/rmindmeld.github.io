## What is MindMeld?

MindMeld is my personal laboratory where I explore and document the fascinating interplay between artificial intelligence and human creativity. As someone deeply interested in AI's creative potential, I curate and share AI-generated content while adding my human perspective and insights.

### Human Curation

Every piece of AI-generated content is carefully selected and contextualized with my personal insights,  observations and interests.
