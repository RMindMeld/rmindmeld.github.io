## Episode Background

Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol" is the story that transformed Christmas to what we know. More than a storyâ€”it's a powerful message of hope, redemption, and the transformative power of compassion. To celebrate this season of Joy, Christmas, and celebration, I decided to embark on a unique experiment that celebrates Christmas, summarizing this master piece using NotebookLM.

But what is different about this episode? 

NotebookLM is a powerful took that can be used for educational purposes, summarizing, providing study guides, and most interesting, creating audio/podcast overviews of your own material. 

Officially, NotebookLM creates a podcast overview with 2 voices, the host and the guest (expert), and its officially only in English. However, because there is a small window for customization, I decided to "suggest" that the audio overview to be in other languages: Spanish, German, and French.

Other languages were tried, including Italian, Portuguese, and Aymara, which I hope to release in the future. This pushes the boundaries of what NotebookLM can do. I hope you enjoy this special episode.

## Show Notes

The Podcast was created using only "A Christmas Carol" as sole Source. Then I used the context window/customization with the following:

>- say "Welcome to MindMeld"
>- Mention which book was being reviewed
>- provide a summary of the book
>- The podcast should be done in [language] only, for [language] speaking audience. No other language.
