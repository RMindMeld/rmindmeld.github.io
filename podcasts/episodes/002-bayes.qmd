## Episode Background

This is an example of using notebookLM to generate a podcast episode on a book review of Bayesian Statistics. The episode is a review of the book Bayesian Statistics, which is a different approach to understanding Bayesian Statistics. The episode is 17 minutes and 18 seconds long and was released on January 18, 2024.

## Show Notes

The Podcast was created using the book as only source. Then I used the context window/customization with the following:

> - Say “Welcome to MindMeld, a podcast series powered by NotebookLM.”
> - Shout-out to Fernando, the behind-the-scenes force making this series possible
