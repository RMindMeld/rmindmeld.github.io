## Episode Background

Some time ago, I came by a series of papers/monographs on various topics in econometrics and applied economics. The paper that I was looking at at the time was "Non-parametric Econometrics: A Primer" by J. S. Racine. I was looking at this particular topic as I was developing an implementation of a semi-parametric model known as Smooth-varying coefficient model. Just recently, about a year or so, I look at the whole series of monographs created by the same publisher: Foundations and Trends in Econometrics. 

They have a selected number of monographs on various topics in econometrics and applied economicsm with a handful being published every year. Having access to them via the library at work, I got few of them to read, and put few others on the to-read list. Unfortunately, they fell on the long list of readings that I have, and I never got to them. 

Now, thanks to NotebookLM, I decided to create a mini-series on few of their monographs. This one is the first episode of the mini-series, where I requested NotebookLM to generate a podcast episode to introduce the series, and hopefully, generate some interest in the topics that will be covered. I already have the "whole" series obtained, but I will only be posting them as I listen/read them, to make sure they provide good content.

## Show Notes

The Podcast was created using all the monographs that will be part of the series. Then I used the context window/customization with the following:

>- "Welcome to MindMeld, a podcast series powered by NotebookLM. Note: while we aim for accuracy, details may sometimes be incomplete or incorrect—listeners are encouraged to cross-check sources"
>- This should be an overview to entice listeners to listen into these mini-series of econometrics focus topics. Or read the papers themselves.
>- Shout-out to Fernando, the behind-the-scenes force making these series possible.

There were so many "podcasts" generated that I hit the limit of audio overviews that I can generate in a single day.
