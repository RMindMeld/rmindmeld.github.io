## Episode Background

### Introducing MindMeld and NotebookLM: An AI-Powered Audio Experience

In this inaugural episode, I'm introducing the MindMeld website and its first three blog posts using NotebookLM, a powerful AI tool developed by Google. NotebookLM helps users understand and summarize texts while generating podcast-like audio content that's accessible to the general public.

I first discovered NotebookLM on Twitter, where it was highlighted as a tool for making academic research more accessible by transforming complex papers into formats that general audiences can understand.

### NotebookLM's Evolution

NotebookLM has been available since at least 2023, with its audio overview feature launching on September 11, 2024. When I began using it in July 2024, the platform was still in beta, requiring users to join a waitlist for access. The initial version I experienced would create podcast-like audio content featuring two virtual hosts who would summarize texts while attempting to make the content relatable through casual conversation and examples. This approach sometimes led to interesting results:

- Hosts occasionally strayed from the main topic
- Some interpretations of the text weren't entirely accurate
- Simple inputs could trigger surprisingly deep analysis (which was quite entertaining to hear)

### Recent Updates and Customization

While the early version didn't identify the hosts and simply launched into their "own" podcast format, the latest version includes a context/prompt window for customization. According to the site's guidelines, users can:

- Focus on specific sources when multiple are provided
- Highlight particular topics
- Target specific audiences
- Add personal touches (like greeting specific people)
- Override the default introduction

### The MindMeld Experience

For this episode, I used NotebookLM to generate audio content from MindMeld's first three blog posts. I successfully prompted the hosts to introduce the podcast as "MindMeld Podcasts" and acknowledge their status as virtual hosts.

However, several interesting challenges emerged during this experiment:

1. Despite customization attempts, the hosts sometimes reverted to calling the podcast "DeepDive"
2. Certain content was repeated unnecessarily
3. The system doesn't recognize text formatting like strikethrough, leading to some misinterpretations
4. Even when prompted about the site's AI-generated nature, the hosts attributed much of the content and reviews to FRA

Despite these limitations, the tool offers an intriguing way to transform written content into engaging audio formats.

## Show Notes

The Podcast was created by adding into whole website as a resource into NotebookLM, except for the one page on the podcast. Then I used the context window/customization with the following:

> - Say “Welcome to MindMeld, a podcast series powered by NotebookLM. This first episode explains the purpose and expectations of the site.”
> - Shout-out to Fernando, the behind-the-scenes force making this series possible
> - say “we , for example , are the product of NotebookLM
