# Welcome to MindMeld Podcasts

This is where I will share conversations, experiments, and thoughts using AI tools to generate the podcast content. 

For now, given my knowledge and skills on the subject, I'll generate different types of podcasts. 

- **Full AI**: This means that I will use tools like NotebookLM by Google to create their "DeepDives" podcast. While this tool is still under development, as of Nov 16 2024, it provides you witn a small context/prompt window that you can use to guide the tone of the podcast, based on the content you provide. Earlier versions did not have that, which produced a more generic "babbling" type of podcast.

- **AI-Generated audio**: This means that I will use tools like Claude or ChatGpt to generate Scripts, or refine scripts that I start writting myself. Then, I will use OpenAI text-to-speech to capabilities to produce the podcast. Given current technologies, this will sound less natural than a real podcast, but I will have more control over the content.

- **Talks with AI**: Just recently, I started experimenting with ChatGPT phone-app with audio capabilities. This version of an AI assistant is more versatile than your typical Alexa or Siri, and can hold a conversation with you. I may be able to "record" those conversations to make a different kind of podcast.

- **Talks about me and you**: Your standard Podcast. If I get the equipment time and guests, I will record a podcast with real people, and real conversations about AI, technology, and how it is being used in the real world.

Depending on the "type" of episode, it will include:
   - A full transcript, show notes, and relevant links to topics discussed.
   - Audio conversations, with Prompts that generated it. May include written or audio discussion on the generated content. 
   - Technical details on how the content was generated, and what tools were used.

## About the Format

Each episode will be different:

- They may include discussions or reviews on
   - Books (textbooks, novels, etc.), 
   - concepts (like Ferma's Last Theorem),
   - or some "random" deep dive into a topic (from a single word, to a catch phrase, a story, etc).
   - Real-world applications and observations
   - Interviews with people in the field, or people who have used AI in their work.
