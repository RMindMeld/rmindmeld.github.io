Create an image that represents the intersection of mathematics and neuroscience. Show neural networks with mathematical equations and formulas floating around them, rendered in a blue and purple color scheme. The style should be semi-realistic with abstract elements, showing neurons connecting with mathematical symbols and equations flowing between them. Include some binary code in the background to suggest the computational nature of neural processing.
