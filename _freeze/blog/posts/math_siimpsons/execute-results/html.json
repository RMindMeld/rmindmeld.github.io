The Surprising Math Behind The Simpsons\n\n## Introduction\n\nFor over three decades, \"The Simpsons\" has been a cultural phenomenon, entertaining audiences with its witty humor and satirical take on American life. But beneath the surface of this animated sitcom lies a hidden world of mathematical references and jokes that have delighted math enthusiasts for years. In this post, we'll explore some of the most intriguing mathematical moments in \"The Simpsons\" and even recreate one using Python. Get ready to see Springfield through the lens of a mathematician!\n\n## The Mathematical Minds Behind the Show\n\nIt's no coincidence that \"The Simpsons\" is rife with mathematical easter eggs. Many of the show's writers have advanced degrees in mathematics, computer science, and physics. For instance, Al Jean, one of the original writers and current showrunner, studied mathematics at Harvard University. This background has allowed the writers to sneak in complex mathematical concepts, often as blink-and-you'll-miss-it gags or background details.\n\n## Homer's Doughnut Dilemma: A Topology Lesson\n\nOne of the most famous mathematical references in \"The Simpsons\" occurs in the episode \"Homer3\" (Treehouse of Horror VI). Homer finds himself trapped in a three-dimensional world, where he encounters a equation floating in the air:\n\n$1782^{12} + 1841^{12} = 1922^{12}$\n\nThis equation is a near-miss to Fermat's Last Theorem, which states that no three positive integers a, b, and c can satisfy the equation $a^n + b^n = c^n$ for any integer value of n greater than 2. The equation in the show is not actually true, but it's remarkably close â€“ the left side differs from the right by less than 1 part in $10^{30}$.\n\nLet's verify this using Python:\n\n::: {#c8ecc927 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef check_equation():\n    left_side = 1782**12 + 1841**12\n    right_side = 1922**12\n    difference = abs(left_side - right_side)\n    relative_error = difference / right_side\n    \n    print(f\"Left side: {left_side}\")\n    print(f\"Right side: {right_side}\")\n    print(f\"Difference: {difference}\")\n    print(f\"Relative error: {relative_error:.2e}\")\n\ncheck_equation()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nLeft side: 2541210258614589176288669958142428526657\nRight side: 2541210259314801410819278649643651567616\nDifference: 700212234530608691501223040959\nRelative error: 2.76e-10\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAs we can see, the difference is incredibly small, showcasing the writers' attention to mathematical detail.\n\n## Lisa and Prime Numbers\n\nIn the episode \"Girls Just Want to Have Sums,\" Lisa disguises herself as a boy to attend an all-male math class. During the class, she solves a complex problem involving prime numbers. The problem involves finding two prime numbers that add up to 208. Let's create a Python function to find these primes:\n\n```python\ndef find_prime_pair(target_sum):\n    def is_prime(n):\n        if n < 2:\n            return False\n        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n            if n % i == 0:\n                return False\n        return True\n    \n    for i in range(2, target_sum):\n        if is_prime(i) and is_prime(target_sum - i):\n            return i, target_sum - i\n    \n    return None\n\nresult = find_prime_pair(208)\nprint(f\"The two primes that add up to 208 are: {result}\")\n```\n\nThis function would find the prime pair (5, 203), which indeed add up to 208.\n\n## Pythagorean Theorem and Comic Book Guy\n\nEven the show's notorious pedant, Comic Book Guy, gets in on the mathematical action. In one episode, he wears a t-shirt with the equation $3^2 + 4^2 = 5^2$, which is a representation of the Pythagorean theorem for a 3-4-5 right triangle.\n\nLet's visualize this triangle using matplotlib:\n\n::: {#ea03ec59 .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\ndef plot_345_triangle():\n    fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n    ax.plot([0, 3, 3, 0], [0, 0, 4, 0], 'b-')\n    ax.set_aspect('equal', 'box')\n    ax.set_xlim(-0.5, 3.5)\n    ax.set_ylim(-0.5, 4.5)\n    ax.text(1.5, -0.3, '3', ha='center')\n    ax.text(3.2, 2, '4', va='center')\n    ax.text(1.3, 1.7, '5', ha='center', va='center', rotation=-36.87)\n    ax.set_title(\"3-4-5 Right Triangle\")\n    plt.show()\n\nplot_345_triangle()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display}\n![](math_siimpsons_files/figure-html/cell-3-output-1.png){}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis visualization clearly shows the 3-4-5 right triangle referenced in Comic Book Guy's t-shirt.\n\n## The Simpsons and P vs NP\n\nIn the episode \"Treehouse of Horror VI,\" there's a brief shot of a movie theater marquee that reads \"P = NP.\" This is a reference to one of the most famous unsolved problems in computer science and mathematics. The P vs NP problem asks whether every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer can also be solved quickly by a computer.\n\nWhile we can't solve this problem (it would be worth a million dollars if we could!), we can demonstrate the concept with a simple example of an NP problem: the subset sum problem.\n\n```python\ndef subset_sum(numbers, target, partial=[]):\n    s = sum(partial)\n    \n    if s == target:\n        print(f\"Sum({partial})={target}\")\n    if s >= target:\n        return\n    \n    for i in range(len(numbers)):\n        n = numbers[i]\n        remaining = numbers[i+1:]\n        subset_sum(remaining, target, partial + [n])\n\nnumbers = [3, 34, 4, 12, 5, 2]\nsubset_sum(numbers, 9)\n```\n\nThis function finds all subsets of a given list of numbers that sum to a target value. While verifying a solution is quick (just add up the numbers), finding all solutions can be time-consuming for large sets.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\"The Simpsons\" proves that mathematics can be found in the most unexpected places. From prime numbers to unsolved computer science problems, the show's writers have woven a rich tapestry of mathematical references throughout its long run. These hidden gems not only provide an extra layer of enjoyment for math enthusiasts but also serve as a gentle introduction to complex mathematical concepts for the general audience.\n\nThe next time you watch \"The Simpsons,\" keep an eye out for these mathematical easter eggs. You might just find yourself learning some advanced math concepts while laughing at Homer's latest antics!\n\n## References\n\n- Singh, S. (2013). *The Simpsons and Their Mathematical Secrets*.
